# Book Data Scraper and Cleaner
This project is a Python-based solution designed to scrape book data from http://books.toscrape.com/, clean the collected data, and store it either locally or on Google Cloud Storage (GCS). It's developed to practice and sharpen Python skills, particularly in web scraping, data manipulation with Pandas, and cloud function deployment.
