# 1st-project
Data scraping project from https://books.toscrape.com/, scrape by its category and export it as .csv file. 
I did it in Vs code, and if you want to run it on GCP , simply create a function and paste this code, don't forget to add the necessary libraries as well
This project is like a foundation for practice and sharpen my python skill
